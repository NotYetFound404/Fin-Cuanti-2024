The mechanics of trading usually come in one of two forms:

Trend trading (also divergence or momentum), which is a bet that a quantity, such as a price, will keep moving in its current direction. Reversion trading (also convergence, cycle, or oscillation), which is a bet that a quantity, such as a price, will reverse.

 For example, a signal may be triggered by a shorter lookback moving average going from *less than* to *greater than* a longer lookback moving average. Another signal may be triggered when an oscillator goes from being above a certain set quantity (for example, 20) to below, and so on.
